## (Self-setting Wifi Clock)


![Self-setting NTP clock with auto-dim function](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackmachiela/WifiClock/master/Self-setting%20Wifi%20Clock.jpg)

This project creates a small clock for in the bedroom (or anywhere else). There are no buttons on the clock - at startup, it logs in to your local Wifi, finds an appropriate NTP server pool sets itself, checks daylight savings, and sets itself correctly.

If it gets dark, it automatically dims the clockface so you can still sleep without burning the time into your retinas.

If it can't get a sync for some reason, the LED lights up.
